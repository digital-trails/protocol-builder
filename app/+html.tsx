 *    as far as I can tell there is a default html boilerplate which is what is here. So
 *    If this file were to be removed there will be minimal change in the static HTML output.
 *    Changes to this file can be seen when running `npx expo start --web` as we as when
 *    running `npx expo export -p web; npx serve dist` so long as app.json>expo.web.output='static'.
